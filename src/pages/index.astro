            I'm a senior hardware design engineer from Germany with over 10
            years of experience in designing and developing hardware for power
            electronics systems. Although not officially a software engineer, I
            program in various languages for personal and professional projects.

            Reason this website exists is that I believe everyone should have
            their own place in web and freely express themselves the way they
            want. This is therefore my place where I post about
            hardware/software and other things that interest me. I write mostly
            for myself, but maybe you find them interesting too.

                    circuits, DC Link pre-charging circuits, reference voltage
                    circuits; to design PCBs and schematics of the mentioned
                    motor drives. I was also responsible for the power,
                    efficiency and harsh condition testing of mentioned motor
                    drives with different kind of scenarios such as short
                    circuit behavior, high ambient temperature testing, and
                    overall efficiency in the qualified electronics laboratory
                    with high performance oscilloscopes, temperature measuring
                    devices and power analyzers. Due to my background in
                    electromagnetics which I gained during college days, EMC
                    testing of the drives was also part of my responsibilities.
                    As a part of my job and my personal interest, I also did
                    research and made purchases for electronic equipment and
                    gave tutorials about using them to our team such as
                    oscilloscopes, power analyzers, power supplies, thermal
                    imaging cameras, spectrum analyzers and EMC equipment for
                    the hardware laboratory.
