Lately, I have been trying to guess how much effort I have put into the things that I'm interested in up to now and the general outcomes from them. Not like guessing a quantitative sum of it, but more like a general feeling to assess. This led me to think about the concept of this month's IndieWeb topic:

**Good Enough.**

Two very powerful words. Good; not _perfect_, and enough; not _complete_.

Not always, but from time to time, I'm struggling to escape the dungeon of perfectionism. It's not that much of a big deal, but at some point, the itch keeps staying in the back of my head for an annoyingly long time, if I feel the thing I'm currently working on is not "perfect". I keep coming back to it and stuck on some tiny details that don't obstruct the main function by any means. This, many times, had given me a huge mental load to resolve. I get ideas about it which half of the time lead to nothing and everything starts buzzing in my head. Eventually, either I keep being stuck there with the bee nest or lose interest in it and quit.

Fortunately, this does not happen all the time. I got better over the years and after gathering some experience in my personal and professional life. My savior was learning to say "_Okay, that's good enough_" to myself.

This blog was a big example of it. I have designed it, even before going online, at least 4 times from scratch. Using many different tools and many different ideas. The funny thing is I just blocked myself from writing and publishing no matter how it looks. It had to be _perfect_. It had to be excellent, it had to have all the functions I had imagined from day one... I remember I had spent at least one week every day after my daily job to find the perfect typeface combination and afterwards I just deleted the entire CSS file out of frustration and started over.

This just kept me away from the actual thing: blogging. Just writing and leaving the other parts as _good enough_. Because how it looks right now will probably change over time. Instead of spending an enormous effort perfecting it, I chose to get rid of the bee nest in my head and feel the serenity of good enough.

<span style="display: block;" id="rn">
It is not perfect, but good enough. It will always be. It will change many times and it will never be complete, just good enough.
