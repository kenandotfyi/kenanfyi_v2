I have always wanted to write something which starts with "On..." like an
author or a philosopher who will just spit their rant out for 5000 pages on a
subject like behavior of humans on decision making, a huge subject of mathematical
principles of natural philosophy or more honest stuff like [bullshit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385.On_Bullshit).

**My admire for such text was always there although I have mostly hard time understanding
such deep work**. Obviously I‘m nowhere near the level of these genius minds but that‘s the
point of starting this blog. This is not a professional medium that I present my work on and
create hypothesis on unsolved issues of science or academical experiments that I perform,
but a place to express my thoughts and create a digital garden of ideas, processes, learnings, outcomes and _many other bits in my life._

From another perspective, this is merely an experimental project of mine related to web,
design, machines, software, AI and many other things that I consume on a daily basis.
Having a broad range of interests is exhausting but also very rewarding to some extent
if you keep yourself in a more realistic world than an utopia and try to gather meaningful
information out of it. So this is going to be a -hopefully- long journey and my very own
place in the vast, strangled and mostly gibberish world wide web.

## Why a blog though?

Answer is simple: Writing is hard. Writing, especially writing in a way that people get
interested in what you are saying is extremely hard. And that is the reason I wanted to
do this in public. I have my own system of note-taking since years and I have already
gathered a lot of notes but if someone looks at them except me, they would probably
think what kind of a mess is that?! To me, it is perfectly clear in a very sophisticated
way but still, I know that they are „just“ for my future self to understand.
A blog on the other hand -although I believe I will not have many readers-
is a place where I have to push myself to write and express more clearly.
If a reader understands what I‘m saying and what I‘m trying to transfer,
that is a job done for this experiment. I would then consider myself successful.
And if you are reading these lines right now, you have probably heard about learning
in public and this philosophy of Richard Feynman, where you can self-evaluate yourself
in a topic you are learning at the moment. This technique is the main approach for
me for years to learn something new. If I can explain something to someone who has
no idea about that thing and let them understand, I can tell myself that
I know that subject. Otherwise, I have to review and repeat.

## Measuring the feedback

You might ask, yes but you don‘t get any feedback in a blog where the readers
do not have the ability to interact. That‘s completely true. But it still does not
eliminate the hypothesis of trying to write clearly in a public audience.
It is like yelling in the middle of a big square in a city where no one is
interested in you. But, still, you are in that audience. You are public.
You have to be careful and you have to make sure your thoughts resonate somehow somewhere.

We'll see what comes next.
