<ol class="quest-list">
<li>Please introduce yourself.</li>
Hey, it's Kenan.

<li>How long have you been making websites?</li>
The earliest memory I could remember is 2004-2005, where I was trying to create my website for GPU reviews because I wanted to do something similar to computer magazines like CHIP. I used a free domain from an e-mail provider. That was a thing at that time. You could get a subdomain from them. After that I did some stuff but stopped for a long time afterwards until 2011-2012. 

<li>And what got you into the hobby?</li>
I like creating stuff and dabbling with it.

<li>What kind of website are you most interested in?</li>
Technical websites, blogs, interactive infographics, scientific writings.

<li>What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</li>
Mostly as I go along. I also have a todo list where I dump stuff if I get an idea.

<li>Please link to your biggest inspirations.</li>
Probably [Gwern](https://gwern.net). Also [Neil Panchal](https://neil.computer/).

<li>What's your favourite part about making websites?</li>
Having a playground and a complete blank sheet I guess.

<li>And the thing you struggle with the most?</li>
Not a struggle maybe, but as much as I like file-based routing, I am not very happy with the authoring experience in Markdown/MDX files. Especially for custom stuff.

<li>Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</li>
I did for a long time in the v1 of this website, but now I'm trying some different layouts.

<li>How confident are you with CSS?</li>
Quite confident as I like to think. Probably not that much in reality.

<li>Do you know how to correctly use &lt;dl&gt;?</li>
Nope.

<li>What is your favourite HTML element?</li>
Probably `pre` and `code` for ASCII stuff. 

<li>If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</li>
If it's content-heavy, then `npm create astro@latest`. 

<li>Do you know JavaScript?</li>
Yes, and I don't like it. I think it is a burden we all need to get along with. Web should have been based on a better foundation than this.

<li>How about PHP?</li>
I do. Not so much, but enough. I wrote a plugin for my DokuWiki instance once. I guess that's enough to say I could find my way in a PHP codebase in need. Also I can modify Wordpress sites.

<li>Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</li>
For sure. It was quite minimal and retro in the v1. Now it is a little more minimal-modern. I'm sure it will look different next year though.

<li>Are you more focused on content or design?</li>
70% design I believe. Simply because it is my playground. I wish to write more this year though.

<li>Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</li>
I own more domain names than I'll ever need.

<li>What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</li>
Love'em.

<li>Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</li>
Not always. But yeah it's valid. Couple of warnings only.

<li>What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</li>
Fan of them. I'm designing my button section for the footer at the moment.

<li>What do you think of button walls in particular?</li>
Generally like them. But sometimes they are too much, that it distracts.

<li>If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</li>
Every beginning is different. So, completely different.

<li>Are you envious of other people's websites?</li>
All the time. But in a good way. I love finding a good website and adding it to my favourites.

<li>What text editor do you use?</li>
Neovim and Zed.

<li>Why do you use that one?</li>
Because I'm keyboard oriented and Vim feels like home. I like Zed for the minimal look and use Vim mode in Zed too. I wish Neovim has a better and simple configuration like Helix though. Managing my init.lua and the burden of it keeps me coming to Zed all the time.

<li>Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</li>
I use Astro since a long time and it takes care of image optimizations. So yes, mostly in the server where my website lives.

<li>This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</li>
I have no idea.

<li>How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</li>
The content is probably couple of hundred KB. But the images and the video on the indexpage makes it go up couple of MB.

<li>Do you keep local backups of your files?</li>
Kind of.

<li>Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</li>
I appreciate both, as soon as they don't look generic.

<li>Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</li>
I am a huge Dieter Rams fan and I always try to follow his color combinations. Not successfully all the time though.

<li>Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</li>
Making websites? No.

<li>Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</li>
Nope. I am an hardware design engineer, so lots of electronics engineers around me. 

<li>Do people in your real life know about your website?</li>
Some of them, yes.

<li>Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?</li>
My goal for 2026 is to at least post something every month. Not so often I guess. But I fine-tune the design almost weekly.

<li>And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</li>
All the time. Because I get an itch, if I have an idea to implement.

<li>Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</li>
All of them I guess.

<li>Do you do web design professionally?</li>
Nope. Not officially a web designer. 

<li>If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</li>
I think I could. But I have my career in electronics engineering and I am happy with how things are currently. I am happy I could invest my free time on web design.

<li>Do you communicate with people by email very much?</li>
At work, yes. Privately, not as much as I do at work.

<li>Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</li>
That's my goal too. I was very active in Twitter and stopped using that shithole, when Space Karen bought it. Only social media app I have in my smartphone is Mastodon. 

<li>How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</li>
I'm afraid I have to use WhatsApp, because it is the defacto in Germany. I wish my friends and family would use something else, so I could switch too.

<li>Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</li>
Sometimes. But I listen to music all the time anyway.

<li>Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</li>
Currently just one. Except the services I self-host.

<li>On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</li>
Many. My goal for the next periods is to post about electronics.

<li>Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</li>
I try. But I guess being behind a keyboard pushes you to construct a persona online. I hope I'm not doing it in a bad way though. 

<li>Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</li>
Nope. But life is long. Hopefully.

<li>Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</li>
CSS came a long way and I think it's trajectory is right. HTML works anyway. I don't mind the ambiguities around it.

<li>What are practices that you think people should avoid?</li>
For the IndieWeb community, I believe people are already doing a good job. I try too. But for other circles I guess there are a lot of things to avoid, which I can't list them all here. Stop using Substack is the first one came to my mind for example.

<li>What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more?</li>
Aria labels, semantic HTML, POSSE. I am bad at it too.

<li>Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</li>
Try to.

<li>Do you consider different browsers?</li>
All the time. But I generally don't like Chromium based ones. A guilty pleasure is Arc though. 
I hate how they handled it and how that company is building that abomination called Dia now. I wish they'd open-source Arc and maybe it could be de-googled.

<li>Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</li>
Firefox. But I am not happy about where it is going. So I don't know. I like qutebrowser too, but it is very primitive in terms of adblocking at the moment. If you have a better recommendation, please tell me. 

<li>And what OS are you on?</li>
All of them :) I hate Windows, but have to use at work. Personally I am on macOS, but I use Linux since I have my servers running on Ubuntu too. I occassionally install Arch on my machine to just see how things are going, but macOS is my choice

<li>Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</li>
I use it simply because of the hardware. As an hardware engineer, I appreciate the effort and advanced techniques they put into it. Unfortunately Apple is also not my favourite company, but Mac hardware is the best out there.

<li>Are your websites mobile-friendly?</li>
Yes, I always design for desktop and mobile.

<li>What are your thoughts on autoplay?</li>
Does not bother me.

<li>What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</li>
I guess I am on [retronaut webring](https://webring.dinhe.net/), but I'm not sure. 
I will join others.

<li>Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see in that sort of page?</li>
I don't think I do.

<li>Are your websites "cliche", in your opinion?</li>
Nope. 

<li>What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</li>
Minimal, but unique. Active, but not distracting. And yes, that is my goal. 

<li>Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</li>
I draw sometimes. Not as much as I used to do though. I also shoot analog and digital photographs and the hero images on top of the pages, as well as the video background in the index page are all my photos.

<li>What are your favourite resource sites?</li>
I don't think I have a favourite one. 

<li>Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</li>
Yes, redesigning my navigation. I have yet to find my final navigation.

<li>What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</li>
Don't scare to publish your website. You can try to make it look on the go.

<li>Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</li>
I always use components to design my website and try to put styles on component level to prevent leakage and keep it organized.

<li>What do you think of frameset layouts?</li>
Not use them. 

<li>How about table-based layouts?</li>
Tables are underrated. But for layouts, I guess we have better tools since years now. I designed my first website I mentioned above completely with tables thought. That was the case in the past.

<li>Do you subscribe to the ideas of "one-column", "two-column" and "three-column" layouts? Do you use any of these?</li>
Yes. For my post pages I use two-columnd and the second column is for sidenotes.

<li>Do you spend longer on the HTML or the CSS?</li>
CSS definitely.

<li>Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.</li>
I don't think so.

<li>Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?</li>
I make them if I need them.

<li>Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</li>
I am quite advanced in terms of programming on the web. But for design, I guess I am somewhere in between.

<li>Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</li>
If I see something unique, of course.

<li>How did YOU learn how to make websites?</li>
I have seen a series that teaches you how to make a website on the local newspaper. Yes, on the printed newspaper.

<li>Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</li>
Yes, JavaScript is for that isn't it?

<li>Thoughts on floating elements?</li>
I use them in my sidenotes. I also like dropcaps.

<li>When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</li>
I almost never use em. I almost always try to use rem. But for some quick stuff I use px and % too.
For `translateX`, `translateY` I use % only for example.

<li>Do you have a favourite font?</li>
I do. I use JetBrains Mono locally in my editor, I like Iosevka too. Lexend is a nice one to read. 
iA Writer series are also very good for reading. IBM Plex is one of my favourites. I like Berkeley Mono too, but not yet made the decision to buy it.

<li>Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?</li>
It could be fun, yeah.

<li>Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?</li>
Always. I check [Ye Olde Blogroll](https://blogroll.org/), [powRSS](https://powrss.com/), [personalsit.es](https://personalsit.es/), [Dead Simple Sites](https://deadsimplesites.com/) all the time.

<li>Do you bookmark other people's websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?</li>
Yes! That's a good thing. You can see my bookmarks [here](/bookmarks). I would feel extremely happy, if I would see someone bookmarked my website. I guess Webmentions are going in a good direction in that matter.

<li>What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?</li>
My hover previews at the moment. And the general aesthetics.

<li>Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?</li>
Yes. I like electronics-related stuff. I like Casio watches. I like tools. I like keyboards.

<li>How often and for how long are you online?</li>
Puh. I work on computers all the time. I guess I am "online" for the whole day.

<li>When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?</li>
Technical people as well as bloggers. But anyone is welcome. Except fascists, racists, homophobes, transphobes, bigots and alike.

<li>Have you ever been interested in XHTML?</li>
I did! But it was a very short period.

<li>Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript?</li>
Yes. Frequently. I write scripts in Python occasionally at work and I am currently building my own headless CMS for this very website and the backend is in Go. For this website I wrote a backlinks checker in Rust last year. But that was solely for learning purposes and I ported it again to Typescript since it is more convenient for build step.

<li>Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?</li>
Yes! I used Eleventy for my first iteration of [kenan.fyi](/). I tried Next.js too, but that thing is not thought for blog sites. Then I've found Astro and stuck with it since then. I don't plan to change it. I played with Hugo, Jekyll and couple of others, but Astro works in the way my brain works.

<li>Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?</li>
I hava a lightweight analytics I self-host and does not set any cookies for the sole reason of me being curious. I don't do anything with that statistics. In fact I nuked the service at least 10 times already because I wanted to try something else. For now, it's active, but I sometimes think about disabling it completely.

<li>Do you frequent forums? Which ones?</li>
Not that much to be honest. Except Reddit and Stackoverflow. Maybe sometimes Obsidian forums too. But I prefer them to Discord any day.

<li>Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?</li>
Yes, in the editor. It's all Markdown with MDX additions. When I'm done with my headless CMS, I will switch to that though.

<li>Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you're cool?</li>
They do. But I don't think I am.

<li>Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?</li>
Not out of shame, but out of not giving a shit. This is my playground. I destroy and build it from scratch if I want. I have no fears of it.

<li>Would you close down your website if you couldn't update it, or would you leave an archive?</li>
No. It will stay online as soon as I'm alive.

<li>Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?</li>
Not so much.

<li>Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?</li>
I have none at the moment.

<li>And do you optimise the images on your website?</li>
Yes. Astro does that. Sometimes I took them out from the optimization pipeline though.

<li>We're out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? ....other than exhausted.</li>
That was fun! I mean, who wouldn't like a good questionnaire?
